# Executable Books

The Executable Books Project is an international collaboration to build open source tools that facilitate publishing computational narratives using the Jupyter ecosystem.

We are a community who steward:

- [Jupyter Book](https://jupyterbook.org): Build beautiful, publication-quality books and documents from computational material like Jupyter Notebooks.
- [MyST Markdown](https://mystmd.org): An extended Markdown format designed for the future of technical communication and publication.

As well as many, many other tools for parsing, headless execution of Jupyter Notebooks ([caching](https://github.com/executablebooks/jupyter-cache) and in the [browser](https://github.com/executablebooks/thebe)), popular sphinx extensions (e.g. [copy-button](https://github.com/executablebooks/sphinx-copybutton), [sphinx-design](https://github.com/executablebooks/sphinx-design), [sphinx-thebe](https://github.com/executablebooks/sphinx-thebe)), and many [scientific templates](https://github.com/myst-templates) for writing journal articles and presentations.

## Contribute to a Project üë©‚Äçüíª

[Ask a question](https://github.com/orgs/executablebooks/discussions) or [show and tell](https://github.com/orgs/executablebooks/discussions/categories/show-and-tell) the community about your project or use of MyST, or come to a [monthly team meeting](https://executablebooks.org/en/latest/meetings/index.html).

All of our projects are open source and welcome and and all contributions -- from documenting problems you run into, adding to documentation, [telling people](https://twitter.com/executablebooks) about your project and our mission, and _of course_ contributing to the code! Please review our [Code of Conduct](../CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) to learn about some of the conventions we follow.

## Be inspired, build a book ‚ú®üìñ‚ú®

Our [Gallery of Jupyter Books](https://executablebooks.org/en/latest/gallery.html) has contributions from across the community. See the [Jupyter Book documentation](https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/intro.html) to get up and running to create your first online book, with executable, interactive content.

## Learn about MyST Markdown ‚úçÔ∏èüë©‚Äçüî¨

Visit <https://mystmd.org> to see an interactive demo of working with MyST -- an extensible and powerful markup language for technical writing. You can use it to [create books](https://jupyterbook.org/), write [scientific papers](https://mystmd.org/guide/creating-pdf-documents), or use [MyST in JupyterLab](https://github.com/executablebooks/jupyterlab-myst).
